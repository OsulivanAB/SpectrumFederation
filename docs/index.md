# Spectrum Federation

![Addon Banner](assets/readme/SpectrumFederation.jpg)

World of Warcraft addon for the Spectrum Federation guild on Garona.

## About Us

Spectrum Phoenix (Alliance) and Spectrum Rage (Horde) were forged from the collective desire of LGBTQIA (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, Intersex, Asexual) WoW players, and their friends, to find a guild free of the bigotry and intolerance that seems to reign free elsewhere in the game, as it does in the real world. Being around since WoW vanilla, Spectrum Phoenix and Spectrum Rage grew steadily as prospective members discovered the existence of our family.

In Dragonflight, with Blizzard lowering the barriers between Horde and Alliance, Phoenix and Rage merged to become the cross-faction guild Spectrum Federation.

The reason for our guild's existence is simple: To provide a fun, friendly and supportive atmosphere for LGBTQIA players and their allies to game in and be themselves without fear of prejudice or homophobia. We consider ourselves a casual guild, though many of our members enjoy raiding, mythic+ and PvP as well.
